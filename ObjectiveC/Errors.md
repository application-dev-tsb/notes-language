## Errors
Errors are an unavoidable part of any appâ€™s lifecycle. If you need to request data from a remote web service, for example, there are a variety of potential problems that may arise, including:
- No network connectivity
- The remote web service may be inaccessible
- The remote web service may not be able to serve the information you request
- The data you receive may not match what you were expecting
