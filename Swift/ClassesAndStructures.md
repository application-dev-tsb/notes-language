# Classes and Structures
Classes and structures are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your programâ€™s code. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your classes and structures by using exactly the same syntax as for constants, variables, and functions.

```swift
struct Resolution {
    var width = 0
    var height = 0
}

class VideoMode {
    var resolution = Resolution()
    var interlaced = false
    var frameRate = 0.0
    var name: String?
}
```
